### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's John & I like hacking things together in a handful of languages.

You can see some metrics for the current year below;

*(An explanation of the rank assigned is available [here](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#github-stats-card).)*

Additionally, you can see my preferred languages below;

I'm currently focusing on learing the excellent Go (/ Golang) after which I plan to learn either Java or C#.

I also have an interest in learning both C and Python's Django framework - however, Java and C# are both uniquly valuable in the Irish jobs market, and one of them will therefore be my next priority.

So many languages, so little time!
