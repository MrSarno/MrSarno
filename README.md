### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's John & I like hacking things together in a handful of languages.

You can see some metrics for the current year below;

*(An explanation of the rank assigned is available [here](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#github-stats-card).)*

Additionally, you can see my preferred languages below;

I'm currently focusing on learning C#, which is somewhat overrepresented above due to the .csproj & .sln files.

I had previously started learning the excellent Go (/ Golang), which I plan to get back to at a later point. It's fun!
