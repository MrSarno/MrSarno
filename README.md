### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's John & I like hacking things together in a handful of languages.

You can see some metrics for the current year here;

Additionally, you can see my preferred languages here;

I'm currently focusing on learing the excellent Go (/ Golang) after which I plan to learn Java.

I also have an interest in learning both C and Python's Django framework, however Java is uniquly valuable in the Irish jobs market and will therefore be my next priority. So many languages, so little time!
